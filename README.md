# Backend Interview Problems

This directory contains one subdirectory per interview problem. Each contains
its own `README.md` file which explains the specifics. Fork this repo, then
complete all of the partial projects as described, so we can see your git
usage.

This repo is configured to use IntelliJ as it's an industry standard but you're
not required in any way to have or use a monolithic IDE. Whatever you're
comfortable with: nothing presented here is meant as a "trick," nor should it
take too long to complete.
